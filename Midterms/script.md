# SCRIPT

## **Introduction**
XYZ is an amalgamation of Hangman and Shooting. Just like Hangman, the player is tasked with guessing the word, BUT THIS TIME, they also have to be dextrous enough to be able to shoot its letters, all the while dodging rocks and killing enemies.

## **Levels and Menu**
Our game is split across multiple levels - each having a word theme of its own. In addition - each level will have interesting bits like monsters, powerups and higher difficulty - either in vocabulary or shooting. So let's start with Level 1.

## **Gameplay**

### **Player movement**
As you can see, the shooter can move and rotate using the Arrow and WASD keys.

### **Goals and actions**
Using these actions, they fill the blanks visible on the top with the hidden word. 

*(In the middle of screenshot where CAT is being generated)* The player is able to shoot letters that seems to generate the word cat.
*(After CAT is complete)* Now that we have completed the word, we are moved to the next level

### **Extra bits**
* Monsters and Powerups: On higher levels the player must also tackle monsters and collect powerups. This is to add variety to the game and make it more exciting

### **Final Score Screen**
After completing all the levels, the player is shown the final screen displaying the score and other stats.

## **Closing Remarks**
A final closing remark. we'd like to describe some ongoing improvements that we are undertaking. Specifically - the proffessor had raised an interesting important point in our last meeting - during the inital part of a level there is not a lot of strategy involved and the player must randomly shoot letters as they appear for the first few seconds.

We have brainstormed a few solutions for this problem and should have a prototype soon.

Finally, we'd like to thank the Professor for his awesome lectures and useful feedback. We appreciate being given this opportunity to present the game and look forward to your feedback.
