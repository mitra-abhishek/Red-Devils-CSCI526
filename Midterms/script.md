# SCRIPT

## **Introduction**
Our game is an amalgamation of Hangman and Shooting. Just like Hangman, the player is tasked with guessing the word, BUT THIS TIME, they also have to be dextrous enough to be able to shoot its letters, all the while dodging rocks and killing enemies.

## **Levels and Menu**
The game is split across multiple levels - each having a word theme of its own. In addition - each level will have interesting bits like monsters, powerups and higher difficulty - either in vocabulary or shooting. So let's start with Level 1.

## **Gameplay**

### **Player movement**
As you can see, the shooter can Rotate using the Arrow and Move using the WASD keys. They can shoot using the Space bar.

### **Hint Letters**
Let's take a pause. What's that Green letter? So, to introduce strategy in the initial few seconds of the game (rather than just random shooting), we indicate alphabetical closeness of a falling letter to a letter in the word through color gradient - Red through Green.
\
*(In the middle of screenshot where FOX is being generated)* The player is able to shoot letters that seems to generate the word FOX.
\
*(After FOX is complete)* After completing the word, the score for the level is displayed, let's move to the next level

*(When the pause for Monster appears)* Checkout the monster on the left. On this level, the player can dodge or shoot these monsters and their bullets
\
*(FIAT word)* And we continue playing... The player seems to be uncovering the word FIAT - a car company, the theme for the level.
*(When powerup appears)* Ran out of bullets? Ran out of time? Or maybe chose incorrect letters? Powerups are here to save you. You can collect them.

### **Final Score Screen**
After completing all the levels, the player is shown the final screen displaying the score and other stats.

## **Closing Remarks**
A final closing remark. we'd like to describe some improvements that we have made. Specifically - the proffessor had raised an interesting important point in our last meeting - during the inital part of a level there is not a lot of strategy involved and the player must randomly shoot letters as they appear for the first few seconds.
\
We have brainstormed a few solutions - including the colored letters solution that was visible earlier. We are still experimenting on stuff and look forward to the analytics.

Finally, we'd like to thank the Professor for his awesome lectures and useful feedback. We appreciate being given this opportunity to present the game and look forward to your feedback.
